# Garden Watering System Controller on Lolin32 Lite

This [MicroPython](http://micropython.org/) project on an [ESP32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP32) uses
[Wunderground](https://www.wunderground.com) to determine if
significant rain has fallen in the last day and if so disables the garden watering system to conserve water. It reports the rainfall and system status to [ThingSpeak](https://thingspeak.com).
